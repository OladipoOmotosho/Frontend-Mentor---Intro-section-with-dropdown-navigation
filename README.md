## My process

Started with the desktop design, then i added the active states for the dsktop design.
I then went to the responsiveness which is the the Mobile design and i added the active states also,
before finalizing the whole project with a little bit of javascript functionalities.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Mobile-last workflow

## #what-i-learned

I experienced difficulties while trying to implement some CSS functions and due to this i was able to learn new concepts and ways of doing things
such as referencing tags and hover effects and lots more...all in all it was quite educative taking on this project.
